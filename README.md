# Weapon Cosmetics View Improved

(Formerly: View Locked Weapon Cosmetics)

I always hated how I could see locked character cosmetics, but not see locked weapon cosmetics...

So I made a mod!

With View Locked Weapon Cosmetics installed, you will now be able to see all weapon skins and trinkets for your weapons, including the locked ones - the same as on the character cosmetic screen!

Plus a load of other QoL improvements to the weapon cosmetics screen!

Displays locked items from Commodore's Vestures, Hestia's Blessings, Penances and the Commisary.

Also includes a wishlist system for premium shop items. Allowing you to add items to your wishlist to receive a notification on the character select screen when the item is available for purchase.

Requires MasterItems Community Patch

Note: This mod only lets you preview these items, you are not able to equip them. If you want that, then you'll need to purchase the items
in-game from the respective shop.
